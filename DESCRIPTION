Description: Provides a function to convert existing R functions into "errorized" versions 
    with added logging and handling functionality when encountering errors or warnings. 
    The errorize function accepts an existing R function as its first argument and 
    returns a R function with the exact same arguments and functionality. However, 
    if an error or warning occurs when running that "errorized" R function, it will save a 
    .Rds file to the current working directory with the relevant objects and information 
    required to immediately recreate the error.
